A rhythm-based tennis game created for Hack With The Beat 2025

# 🎾 Rhythm Rally 🎶  
**A rhythm-based tennis game built for the 2025 Hack With The Beat hackathon.**

## 🧠 About the Project  
Rhythm Rally is a browser game that combines music, tennis, and timing. Players must “return” tennis balls on the beat, improving rhythm, focus, and reaction speed. The game uses real-time audio cues synced with falling tennis balls, rewarding precise timing and hand-eye coordination.

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys to move your paddle.
- Tennis balls drop in sync with the music beat.
- Hit the ball at the right time to score.
- Miss the beat and the ball resets!

## 🔧 Built With  
- **HTML/CSS/JS**  
- [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/) – canvas drawing and visuals  
- [**Tone.js**](https://tonejs.github.io/) – music timing and beat logic  

## 💡 Inspiration  
As a tennis player, I’ve always thought rhythm is underrated in training. So I created Rhythm Rally to fuse my love for tennis and music into something interactive, fun, and timing-based—perfect for a music-themed hackathon.
